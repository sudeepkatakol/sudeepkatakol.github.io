* This project was aimed to bring out the evolution of cooperation in our society by examining the cooperative hunting
scenarios in lions extensively studied by biologists over the years. The objective was to simulate the random behaviour
of animals and show how their actions converge/diverge under different conditions. 

* **Contribution:**
  * Through Nash Q-Learning we were able to teach multiple predators the desired behavior and were able to simulate three different scenarios under different conditions - one in which the animals fight, one in which they cooperate, and one in which they mix both these strategies.
