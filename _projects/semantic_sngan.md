Spectral Normalization is the current state-of-the-art method for enforcing the Lipschitz constraint on the discriminator of the GAN. However, it's not perfect. I was interested specially in the sensitivity of the discriminator to minor changes in the image input to it. While stability to small changes in the image is a desirable property of the discriminator, itâ€™s not satisfied by the discriminator and some interesting trends are observed.

## SEMANTIC SNGAN

### Contribution:

* Detection & analysis of the problems with **Spectral Normalized GANs** & attempts to improve them to produce meaningful & coherent generations.
* Designed a method to **quantitatively estimate local and global coherence** captured by the discriminator.
