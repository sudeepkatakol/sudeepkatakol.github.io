* This an ongoing project where we use a different method to detect objects than the one used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09718">Object-based Visual Reasoning </a>. The paper uses pre-trained Faster RCNN architecture to detect CLEVR objects while we use traditional CV tools to detect objects, thus reducing training time and increasing the speed of reasoning at test time. 
* This was also the final project of Deep learning course at BITS Goa. I, being a Teaching Assistant for the course, mentored about 15 groups on the same.
