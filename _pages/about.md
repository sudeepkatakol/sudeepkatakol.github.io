Hey, I'm Sudeep.
I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine learning) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I graduated from BITS Pilani, Goa, India with dual majors in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2020. 

My current research interests revolve around the theory of deep neural networks. While deep learning is used ubiquitously, we seldom fully understand why it works so well. During my graduate studies, I intend to work towards demystifying the role of neural networks in many of their applications. 

Prior to joining the University of Michigan, I interned at the Computer Vision Center, Barcelona where I was fortunate to work with Dr. Luis Herranz, Dr. Joost van de Weijer and Dr. Antonio M. LÃ³pez. During the course of one-and-a-half years, I worked on image compression, transfer learning, continual learning and generative models. 

I'm also a huge sports enthusiast; I particularly love playing cricket, badmintion and chess.
