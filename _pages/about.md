Hey, I'm Sudeep Katakol.

I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Masters in Mathematics at BITS Pilani, Goa, India. 

I wish to pursue research in the field of Machine learning. My long term goal would be to build interpretable and explainable models for learning from data. 

I am also interested in the field of Abstract Algebra.

I also love playing Cricket, Badmintion and Chess.
